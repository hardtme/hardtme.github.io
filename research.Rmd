# Summary of My Past Research Projects

**Student Researcher**, RUSIS@OSU Research Experience for Undergraduates (Summer 2019)

Dr. Javier Rojo, Professor of Statistics, Oregon State University

* Collaborated with team of three to research survival analysis 

* Coded simulations in R to compare the performance of survival analysis estimators under a stochastic order constraint

* Graphed and interpreted simulation results in terms of bias and mean squared error

* Presented research results to RUSIS@OSU advisory committee


**Student Researcher**, Iowa State University Freshman Honors Mentor Program (Spring 2017)

Dr. Steve Butler, Associate Professor of Mathematics, Iowa State University (now [Morrill Professor]{https://www.provost.iastate.edu/faculty-success/awards/university/faculty-awards/morrill-professor-recipients} at Iowa State University)

* Researched graph theory with Dr. Butler and another undergraduate

* Derived and simplified equations for probabilities of all five families of graphs with at most two trees in a forest-building process

* Utilized Sage mathematics software to numerically derive patterns in the probabilities of a specific graph family; patterns found were proven correct

* Publication:
